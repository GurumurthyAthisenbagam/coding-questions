This is similar to intersection to two linkedlist. Since we have two nodes and finding common ancestor = intersection. 

When we walk upward from two nodes p and q toward the root:
If their depths (distance to root) are different,
one pointer will reach the root earlier than the other.

ðŸ‘‰ Switching to the other starting node after reaching null ensures that:
Both pointers traverse the same total distance.

It "equalizes" their journeys.
Thus they meet exactly at the lowest common ancestor.
